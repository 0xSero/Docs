# MOR Liquidity Bootstrapping on Uniswap via Arbitrum

One of the primary objectives of the bootstrapping period is to have fair and transparent price discovery for the MOR token. 
Avoiding the typical price spike on the first day of listing the token on the AMM or MEV type attacks.

**Facts for MOR Token Initial List:**
- The initial yield of stETH will be referred to as the "bootstrapping yield"

- About 50,309 of MOR will become claimable by the Protection Fund on day 88 of the fair launch. This will be used to create the MOR AMM pool on Uniswap.

- 4% of the "bootstrapping yield" generated during the 90 day bootstrapping period will be paired with these 50,309 MOR from the Protection Fund.

- As additional MOR are deposited into the Uniswap pool (by MOR holders who earned them from providing Capital or Code) additional stETH yield will be deployed into the Uniswap AMM in proportion.

- This formula is total yield from bootstrapping period will be deployed 1 for 1 with total MOR tokens earned & claimable on day 90.

- Of course not all of the MOR claimable by day 90 will be claimed by those who earned them or even if they are claimed they may not be added to the liquidity of the AMM.
 
So any portion of the "bootstrapping yield" not yet paired with MOR after 10 days (day 100 of the fair launch / May 18th 2024) will be deployed 1% per day until the bootstrapping yield has been completely been added to the AMM.

Best practices for avoiding MEV and other "spipping" type attacks to be developed.
