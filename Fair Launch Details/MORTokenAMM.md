# MOR Liquidity Bootstrapping on Uniswap via Arbitrum

One of the primary objectives of the bootstrapping period is to have fair and transparent price discovery for the MOR token. 
Avoiding the typical price spike on the first day of listing the token on the AMM or MEV type attacks.

**Facts for MOR Token Initial List:**
- The initial yield of stETH will be referred to as the "bootstrapping yield"

- About 50,309 of MOR will become claimable by the Protection Fund on day 88 of the fair launch. This will be used to create the MOR AMM pool on Uniswap.

- 4% of the "bootstrapping yield" generated during the 90 day bootstrapping period will be paired with these 50,309 MOR from the Protection Fund.

- As additional MOR are deposited into the Uniswap pool (by MOR holders who earned them from providing Capital or Code) additional stETH yield will be deployed into the Uniswap AMM in proportion.

- This formula is total yield from bootstrapping period will be deployed 1 for 1 with total MOR tokens earned & claimable on day 90.

- For Example if 66,877 MOR are deposited of the total 668,778 MOR in circulation (10% of supply), then 10% of the bootstrapping yield will be paired with these tokens. 

- This formula will continue until all the bootstrapping yield has been added to the AMM.

Best practices for avoiding MEV and other "spipping" type attacks to be developed.
