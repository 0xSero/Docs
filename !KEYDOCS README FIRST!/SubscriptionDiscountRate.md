# What is the "RSD" Metric? = ""__R__ecurring __S__ubscription __D__iscount" %

## This number represents the discount rate of providing stETH to Morpheus in order to earn 1 MOR, as compared to buying MOR on Uniswap.

## This is an important metric because the network effect desired is those that want to earn MOR and use it for its utility. So by providing stETH one can think of this as "subscribing" to the Morpheus protocol or platform in order to access Compute / AI Inference.

## Right now there is a significant discount to providing stETH vs buying MOR from Uniswap. This calculation is shown on Morlord as currently $14.51 USD worth of ETH yield earning 1 MOR. 

## As the amount of stETH has increased so has the effective price to earn 1 MOR. Also with the daily decay rate of MOR emitted the competition to earn MOR increases between those providing stETH.
