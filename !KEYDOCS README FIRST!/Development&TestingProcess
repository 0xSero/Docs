# Notes on Development, Testnet, Audit, Deployment & Dashboards Best Practices.

## Morpheus Open Source Development Best Practices 
- 1. Planning / Design: Description and spec for what is to be developed. :Backend
- 2A. Begin Coding: Once that backend work is complete then we need to deploy the Code to Testnet. :Backend
- 2B. Begin Dashboard Development: Once backend coding is complete (runs in parrell to Testnet and auditing :Frontend 
- 3. Testnet for Code: Once testnet testers verify backend is functioning as expected ship to auditor. :Backend
- 4A. Audit for Code: The auditor completes their work and remediations are completed. :Backend
- 4B. Dashboard Testing: Deploy Dashboard for Testing before Code goes to mainnet :Frontend 
- 5A. Mainnet Deployment of Code: Either code is directly deployed on Mainnet by devs or preparation of a Deployment Guide. :Backend
- 5B. Mainnet Deployment of Dashboard: Either Dashboard is directly deployed on Mainnet by devs to main branch or preparation of a Deployment Guide. :Frontend
- 6A. Final Checks of Code: Post mainnet deployment, confirmation of correct deployment & expected function. :Backend
- 6B. Final Checks of Dashboard: Testing and deployment of Dashboard to add Frontend UI to the new Smart Contract functions. :Frontend
