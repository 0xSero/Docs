### Who are Morpheus application builders?
They are developers or teams behind end-user applications (smart agents, dashboards, frontends, tools, etc.) at various stages of development, which are integrated with Morpheus and serve the community's needs.

### What is the purpose of rewards for builders?
The rewards for builders are designed to incentivize developers of applications by allowing users to stake their MOR tokens in favor of specific projects.

### What is the difference between coder rewards and builder rewards?
Any contribution to the Morpheus codebase is related to coder rewards, while third-party apps are eligible for builder rewards.

### Who is eligible for builder rewards?
Any individual or project can apply for builder rewards. It's an open market, and users are incentivized to stake MOR towards projects that bring the most value.

### Are there any requirements for projects?
There are no requirements.

### How to get builder rewards?
Builders will need to register their addresses in the decentralized registry along with the desired stake duration. After that, users can stake MOR to this address and direct MOR emissions toward builders.

### How is the amount of rewards for builders determined?
Builders share daily MOR emissions proportionally to the amount of MOR staked for them and the Power Factor multiplier they receive from staking.

### What happens to the MOR accumulated as builder rewards?
To be determined. Proposals that this should go towards builders generating Morpheus protocol fees.

### If a builder stakes their MOR rewards, will they be eligible for the daily Morpheus compute share?
No. The MOR token has to be used for one specific function at a time.

### Are users' tokens locked when they stake them towards a project?
No, users can withdraw their tokens at any time.

### If a user stakes their MOR towards a  builder, will they be eligible for the daily Morpheus compute share?
No, users can only choose one option for staking their MOR tokens.

### What are the benefits for users who stake?
Itâ€™s up to the builders to decide how to incentivize their users to stake MOR.

### Does the project have access to the MOR staked by users?
No, staked MOR will be stored in Morpheus' audited contract.

### How will users learn about the projects?
The idea is to have third-party dashboards where builders can list their applications. There will also be a discussion channel in Discord. There are also community websites such as www.mor.builders which display some of the community projects.

### When are the builder rewards expected to launch?
