## Builder Pool Creation
Users can deposit MOR into Builder pools, which need to be registered first.  
To create a Builder pool, please follow these steps:

- go to the Arbitrum Sepolia [Builders Contract](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/0x649b24d0b6f5a4c3852fd4c0dd91308902e5fe8a#writeProxyContract) page;
- open the **"Contract"** tab, then select the **"Write as Proxy"** tab;
- connect your wallet by clicking the **"Connect to Web3"** button.
- - find and select the `2.createBuilderPool()` function, then input the following parameters:
  - `name`: choose a unique name for your pool;
  - `admin`: enter the wallet address for rewards and pool management;
  - `poolStart`: input the timestamp in the future for the pool launch;
  - `withdrawLockPeriodAfterDeposit`: enter the duration in seconds if you want to lock users' MOR after deposit;
  - `claimLockEnd`: input the timestamp for the builder reward unlock time, i.e., when you will be able to claim the pool's MOR rewards. If you don't want to stake MOR rewards, enter `0`;
  - `minimalDeposit`: set the minimum amount of MOR required to join your pool in WEI. 1 MOR = 1000000000000000000 WEI;
- click **"Write"** and confirm the transaction in your wallet.
