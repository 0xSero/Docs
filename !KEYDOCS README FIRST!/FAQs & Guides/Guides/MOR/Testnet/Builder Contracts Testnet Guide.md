## Builder Pool Creation
Users can deposit MOR into Builder pools, which need to be registered first.  
To create a Builder pool, please follow these steps:

- go to the Arbitrum Sepolia [Builders Contract](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/0x649b24d0b6f5a4c3852fd4c0dd91308902e5fe8a#writeProxyContract) contract;
- open the **"Contract"** tab, then the **"Write as Proxy"** tab;
- connect your wallet by clicking the **"Connect to Web3"** button.

Find and select the `2.createBuilderPool()` function and input the following parameters under `builderPool_(tuple)`:
- `name`: choose a unique name for your pool;
- `admin`: enter the wallet address for rewards and pool management;
- `poolStart`: input the timestamp in the future for the pool launch; 
- `withdrawLockPeriodAfterDeposit`: enter the duration in seconds if you want to lock users' MOR after deposit;
- `claimLockEnd`: input the timestamp for the builder reward unlock time, i.e., when you will be able to claim the pool's MOR rewards. If you don't want to stake MOR rewards, enter `0`;
- `minimalDeposit`: set the minimum amount of MOR required to join your pool in WEI. 1 ETH = 1000000000000000000 WEI.

Follow these steps:

- open the **"Contract"** tab, then the **"Read as Proxy"** tab;
- find and select the `11.getPoolId` function;
- input the name of your pool under `builderPoolName_ (string)` field;
- click **"Query"**.

You will find the pool Id next to `bytes32:`
