# Defining a Morpheus Compute "Subnet"
- A Morpheus Compute Subnet is a specific Compute Provider who is offering "Inference" (LLM & Diffusion Models) to users of Morpheus. 
- A Subnet runs a Node on the network and utilizes the Morpheus / Lumerin Router to match with users requesting Inference. 
- MOR is required to Stake towards each Subnets for them to increase their "rank" with the Router and odds of getting matched to a user.
- MOR is rewarded to Subnets based on the "sessions" they do with users, the longer the sessions remain open the better their "reputation".
- Subnets may open the ability for MOR holders to Stake toward their Subnets and share the rewards (still under development).
- Morpheus is agnostic to where Subnets serve the Inference from, so users of Akash and other GPU networks are welcome to become providers.
