# MOR Burn Function
The Morpheus White paper proposed a burning function for MOR in order to increase scarcity.  
Though the details of how the burning function were left for future implementation. 

## Now in MRC 43 the Burn Address has been added to play a part in the function of the Protocol Owned Liquidity.
See link for details: https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/IN%20PROGRESS/MRC43.md

## Burning & Tail Emissions Section from MRC 43
- This approach will be the basis for implementing the Burn Function described in the white paper.
- The 50% of the MOR held in the PoL will be locked for 16 years. In order to function as the basis for [the #2 epochs Tail Emissions](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/WhitePaper.md#tail-emissions-of-mor).
- The other 50% of the MOR held in the PoL will be sent to a permanent burn address and destroyed forever.
