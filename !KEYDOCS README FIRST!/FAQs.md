## Answers to Your Burning Questions: Morpheus FAQ

## [WHITEPAPER](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/WhitePaper.md) TL;DR
1) Access to AI has become fundamental to modern life.
2) Large centralized companies currently gatekeep access to AI, they actively restrict access & use censorship.
3) Having a personal AI that is open source, decentralized, and permissionless fixes this.
4) Morpheus provides users a decentralized, permissionless, personal AI.
5) Decentralized, permissionless financial rails is also required for true AI freedom.
6) Morpheus uses crypto-based financial rails to reward AI & Smart Agent providers.
7) Follow the white rabbit. Free your mind.

## GENERAL QUESTIONS

### What is Morpheus?
Morpheus is the Decentralized AI network and local inference with purpose to incentivize network of Smart Agents. 

### What is a Smart Agent?  
Smart Agent is a term to describe a general purpose AI that can execute Smart Contracts on behalf of a user using LLM Transformer language that converts human language into actionable code for Web3 interactions using intent based abstractions.

### Who are the founders?
There are no founders. The anonymous authors who called themselves Morpheus, Trinity, and Neo published [the paper](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/YellowPaper.md) on September 2nd, 2023, what marking the beginning of Morpheus.

### Who is on the team?
There is no formal team, company or Foundation. Morpheus is fully decentralized and driven by community of open source contributors.

### What are benefits of having own Smart Agent?
Think of Morpheus as the base layer 0 for the agents to be able to interact across Web3 in a Decentralized fashion. Like what Google search was to the internet in the 90s it allows an aggregation of and accessible to all the Web3 on-chain activity through a Smart Agent controlled by the user that is familiar with them. This in turn should reduce the friction for all users, crypto native and retail, when interacting in the space where everything is currently siloed with a large barrier to entry. While there is no chain for Morpheus itself for people to build dapps on (Yet) it will allow users freedom of accessibility in the space that hasn't been possible before.

### Are there any plans for Morpheus to have its own chain in the future?
At the moment, there are no such plans, but it's not ruled out in the future.

### Why did you choose Ethereum and Arbitrum for the launch?
Ethereum security and capital wise. Pool of stETH was found to be greatest on Arbitrum as well as cheap transaction costs which is vital for using MOR to pay for inference of AI models. Morpheus is chain agnostic by design, there will be more chains integrated later.

### How can I contribute?
There are User and Contributor paths available in four categories:
- Capital Provider
- Code Provider
- Compute Provider
- Frontends builder  
You can find detailed information in this [guide](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/BuildersGuide.md)

### Who can I contact regarding cooperation/marketing proposals?
You don't need anyone's permission to talk about Morpheus or add value as a Contributor. It's all built publicly.

### Where can I get more information about Morpheus?
This FAQ is the best start and Morpheus [Whitepaper](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/WhitePaper.md) next.

## MOR TOKEN AND LIQUIDITY

### What is MOR?   
MOR is the underlying token of the Morpheus network.

### What is the utility of MOR?
The purpose of MOR is to offer extensive utility across various functions within the Morpheus network. The MOR token serves as an on-chain accounting mechanism, calculating rewards based on actual software usage. Additionally, MOR provides proportional to holdings free access to Morpheus' network compute resources.

### How/where can I buy tokens?
You will be able to purchase MOR token ONLY after a 90-day of bootstrapping period (tentatively May 8th). A liquidity pool will be created on Uniswap for the Arbitrum network for this purpose.

### Can I know more about tokenomics?
42 million MOR is the max supply that will ever exist.
Emissions curve starts at 14,400 MOR per day and decreases by 2.468994701 MOR each day until the reward reaches 0 on day 5,833 (~16 years)
- 3,456 MOR per day for Capital Providers.
- 3,456 MOR per day for Code Providers.
- 3,456 MOR per day for Compute Providers.
- 3,456 MOR per day for Community Providers.

### How do I earn MOR?
By providing one of the 4C's:
- Capital
- Code 
- Community (interfaces and tools)
- Compute

### How many phases is the MOR earning categorized into?
Phase 1: Code & Capital (live)
Phase 2: Compute (May/June)
Phase 3: Community (July/August)
Phase 4: Adding More Chains / Yield Types

### Where will the AMM liquidity pool be created?    
It will be Uniswap on Arbitrum chain with wETH/MOR pair. 

### How will the initial liquidity be created?   
MOR tokens by day 90 dedicated to the Protection Fund and leveraged for bootstrapping purpose will be paired with yield generated from deposited stETH and put into AMM liquidity pool. Step by step process explained [here](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Phased%20AMM%20Deployment%20and%20Fair%20Price%20Discovery.md).

### What is the initial price of the MOR token? What will be the marketсap/FDV of the MOR token?
The initial price of the MOR token is unpredictable as it entirely depends on the volume of stETH deposited during the bootstrap period. You can make your own estimates using the price projection tool available on this website: https://morstats.info/mor-price-projection/

### What is Protocol Owned Liquidity?   
Protocol Owned Liquidity refers to the yield generated from stETH contributions that remains within the Morpheus protocol. This yield increases and enhancing the liquidity depth of the MOR token over time. It's important to note that this liquidity is owned and managed by the Morpheus protocol itself rather than individual users.

## BOOTSTRAPPING PERIOD

### What is the purpose of the bootstrapping period?
This period will ensure enough MOR tokens are ready for circulation to fulfill the utility functions of the network, thus avoiding extreme token scarcity and extreme market volatility.

### What is the duration of this period?
90 days, starting from when the Capital and Code Providers contract begins calculating rewards (8th of February) until those MOR tokens are claimable/sendable by users (8th of May). 

### Can I withdraw stETH during bootstrapping?
Yes. You can withdraw stETH, but after 7 days initial lockup.  
Please note: If you deposit additional stETH the 7 day withdraw clock is restarted for all your stETH from that address.

### Is deposited stETH locked?
It is not locked. You are free to withdraw any time after 7 days.

### Why is there a 7 day lock up period?
This measure was introduced in order to avoid people gaming the yield timing as protocol in fact rewards in advance from the moment you deposit, when yield is generated once a day.

### Can I claim MOR token during the bootstrapping period?
MOR token will be only claimable after the bootstrapping period on the 90th Day (~ Mau 8th)

### How can I get involved with Morpheus? 
An onboarding process is described in the [Coder Guide](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Coder%20Guide.md)

### What are the requirements to code contributors?
There are Code Contributor Best Practices on [GitHub](hhttps://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Code%20Contributor%20Best%20Practices.md).

## CAPITAL

### What is stETH?
stETH is a yield generating token that represents an Ethereum token that is staked in Lido.

### How do I get stETH?
stETH can either be minted directly through the Lido or bought on exchanges.

### When does the staking for stEth start?
Staking for stETH starts on Feb 8th

### When does the staking for stEth end?
There is no cut off date. Emissions are a built-in feature of the protocol and will continue for at least 16 years of the first epoch.

### How long should I deposit stETH?
It’s completely up to you. You can deposit for days, weeks, months or years. While your stETH deposited and contributes yield, it earns you MOR rewards.

### Should I withdraw stETH after 90 days?
The choice is yours, you can keep stETH deposited and continue to receive MOR rewards.

### Is there a minimum or maximum amount of stETH one can deposit?
The minimum deposit amount is 0.01 stETH and there is no maximum contribution limit. In other words No Cap on Capital Deposits.

### Have contracts been audited?
Yes, both the community and a dedicated auditor have reviewed the Smart Contracts, see the reports on [GitHub](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/TestingPlan.md).

### How will the stETH deposit contract be managed?
There are 4 of 7 multisig managed by core open source contributors. The address is [MOR.ETH](https://etherscan.io/name-lookup-search?id=mor.eth)

### Is my stETH locked?
It is locked for the first week (7 days) after deposit, and you can withdraw any time after.

### Is the MOR earned proportional to the amount of stETH deposited?
Yes, MOR rewards for Capital start at 3,456 MOR per day and decrease from there over the 16-year emissions curve. This will be rebased to the Capital provider according to their contribution and the total TVL.

### Do I lose earned MOR rewards if I decide to withdraw stETH?
No, you don’t, but you will not earn rewards any longer as you are not the Capital Provider anymore.

### How many MOR tokens I`ll get?
It is a dynamic value that depends on the ratio of your contribution to the total amount of deposited stETH.

### What is APY for staking?
You can’t calculate APY until MOR has a price.

### What are the risks of providing capital?
There are always risks with smart contracts like bugs or vulnerabilities. To ensure a high level of security, the contracts have undergone multiple levels of audits, including community audit, cybersecurity company audit, as well as a public bug bounty campaign. Security reports are publicly available on GitHub. That's also why the Protection Fund 4% of emissions exists.

## COMMUNITY

### What is the Community emissions bucket for?
Community is for Front End and UI Developers as well as Smart Agents.

## COMPUTE AND NODE RUNNING

### What is the Morpheus node?
Currently, Morpheus node is the local LLM, but will be evolving into the Node release by release, for people to be able to provide an inference to a MOR user.

### Is running a node mandatory?
A regular user will be able to use Morpheus without running a node and while running the node isn’t a strict requirement for Capital and Code providers, you won’t be able to provide Compute and Community services without one.

### Are there rewards for running the Morpheus node?
There is no reward for running a Local inference at the moment, however, a full node will be rewarded when providing Morpheus Compute and Community functions.

### How can I run the node?
You need a Mac or PC with Linux Debian with 64gb storage, 16gb VRAM 16gb system RAM and 4CPU core, this a minimum requirement to ensure that there will be no issue on the system side and run most LLMs, follow steps from the guides located in the [readme](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/README.md) on GitHub. 

### Can I run the node on Windows?
Yes, by using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). A guide located in the [readme](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/README.md) on GitHub.

### Can I run the node on VPS?
You can not run one at the moment as there is no version of the node that can operate without a GUI yet.

### Is there a way to run headless nodes?
In the future this is likely. This includes VPS inferences.

### How do I provide compute?
Currently, there is no way to provide compute as the compute contracts are still under development, however you can still spin up and test the local inference of the node.

### Is running a node the same as providing compute?
Running a node is NOT the same as providing compute, compute provision is still being finalized so hold tight for more information.

### Is there a platform through which I could provide compute?
None at the moment. However, work with Akash is underway to create a template to make this possible in a decentralized fashion.

### Will compute providers be able to use cloud infrastructure?
Morpheus is agnostic to how Compute Providers provide Inference Per Second.
Akash, Bittensor, Ritual, EdgeLlama, whatever you want.

### Do compute providers earn emissions during the bootstrapping period?
As the compute contracts are not finalized there will be no way to provide compute at this time, however, the compute emissions will still emit into the bucket to which will be used to reward providers once compute provision is possible.

### How can computer providers earn MOR during the bootstrap period when compute contract isn’t live?
They can’t, until Compute Contracts are up and running which will hopefully be soon after bootstrapping.

### What will happen with accumulated and unused MOR Compute emissions?
MOR emissions intended for Compute Providers will be stored in the reward distribution contract.
