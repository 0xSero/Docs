# Code Contributor Guide To Earning Weights & Their Implied Value

## Tl;dr
The emissions for Code Contributors are calculated based on "weights". An individual's allocation is equal to the individual's weights divided up by the total number of weights times the daily MOR emissions. Morpheus is a marketplace for Code. Thus, Coders are competing to provide high quality code at the best price, and then maintain that code and their weight in the Code Contributors' rewards.

## Weights Emissions Schedule & Supply Cap
The weights earned by Coders are only valuable if they are scarce. 
The number of Coder weights that will be capped at 100 Million weights, at the end of the Coder reward period (16 years).

## Yearly Coding Weights
- Year 1 / 50,000,000
- Year 2 / 25,000,000
- Year 3 / 12,500,000
- Year 4 / 6,250,000
- Year 5 / 3,125,000
- Year 6 / 1,562,500
- Year 7 / 781,250
- Year 8 / 390,625
- Year 9 / 195,312
- Year 10 /	97,656
- Year 11 /	48,828
- Year 12	/ 24,414
- Year 13 /	12,207
- Year 14 /	6,103
- Year 15 /	3,051
- Year 16 /	1,525
- **Total	100,000,000**

**Max weights that can be issued by end of year 16: 100,000,000 weights**
Again, this represents the MAX weights that can be earned in a period. It's the total buy signal in the Coding markeplace. Github maintainers of the 10 Morpheus Reference Implementations should seek to get contributions for something less than this maximum number. And keep in mind if anyone fails to maintain their Code weights WILL be earned by others or returned to the Coding weight reserve.

## Bitcoin Halving Schedule As The Basis For This Code Weight Halving Model
Rewards in real terms have grown, even as weights decline over time.
Lets run through the numbers below as an example.

From September 2nd 2023 to February 8th 2024, developers contributed to the Morpheus open source with very little knowledge of what the implied value of weights or MOR would be (if not zero). $50 USD per weight was a rule of thumb just based on what the average developer cost per hour is globally. So say ~ 21,500 weights were earned during this 5 month and 6 day period (5.2 months). That's 4,134 weights per month times $50 implies a value equal to $206,730 USD worth per month total (spread over dozens of Code Contributors).

February 8th to March 8th only about 2,000 weights were issued (half the 4,000+ weights of previous months) however the implied value of a weight increased to $400 USD each in snapshot #2. So the implied value of the weights actually increased 400% in real terms to $800,000 USD of implied value that month, instead of the $200,000 USD of previous months.

This is the same logic as how Bitcoin mining works. The 4 year havling has reduced the BTC block reward to miners from 50 BTC per block, to 25 BTC, to 12.5 BTC and is currently 6.125 BTC. However despite this Bitcoin miner revenues have increase from Millions of USD worth to Billion of USD worth in the past 15 years, because of course the per Bitcoin price has increased from nothing, to $10 to $1,000 to tens of thousands of USD per BTC over that period.

## Calculating The Implied Value of Weights
**Note the following is all theory, presented as an example for how one could arrive at their own estimate. 
No one knows how much MOR will be worth in ETH or USD or any other currency. 1 MOR = 1 MOR**

Weights in theory have an implied value due to the fact that they translate into MOR token emissions.
3,456 MOR every day (starting on Day 1) are rewarded across all the coders.
So a coder who has 200 weights out of the current 20,000 weights (200 / 20,000 = 1%) would receive 1% of MOR emitted to Coders each day.
In other words, they would be earning 34.56 MOR per day or 12,410 MOR over a year (a little less given the decay rate).

To calculate this into ETH or USD terms is harder, but as an example we know there will be 5,091,984 MOR at day 365.
If the total Morpheus market cap is $100,000,000 USD, that would imply a per MOR price of ~$20 USD.
Our example developer who earned 12,410 MOR over the course of the 1st year will have earned $248,200 USD worth of MOR.
In other words, each weight in this example had an implied value in theory of 248,200 divided by 200 equalling $1,241 per weight over the period of 1 year.

**So keep this in mind if you are bidding on Code work. 
If you are asking for 100 weights, you are saying the Code is in theory worth $124,100 USD worth of MOR.**

## New Coding Weights
**Note the following is all theory, presented as an example for how one could arrive at their own estimate. 
No one knows how much MOR will be worth in ETH or USD or any other currency. 1 MOR = 1 MOR**
The Morpheus code is constantly growing and changing and so let's calculate an example of a new coder who contributes their code.

Lets take for example the coding work being done on the Compute Proofs for the network.  

In this case there are coders bidding to design, implement, and test the Yellowstone proposal's "Decentralized Router".
Say the winning bid is 1,000 weights to contribute the code.
If there are 10 developers involved, each would earn 100 weights. 

Given there are already almost 20,000 weights for existing Coders, this would constitute an additional 5% of the Coding weights.
The new total weights are 21,000 in total and the per weight payout in year 1 would be 0.16 MOR per day, per weight (3,456 divided by 21,000).
So in this example the Compute coding for 1,000 weights has an implied value of 164.57 MOR per day. 
Which equals 60,068 MOR over the first year (less with the decay rate).
Presuming the same $20 per MOR as in the example above that would value this Code contribution at $1,201,360 USD.
Over 10 developers that is a reward of $120,136 USD worth of MOR over the period of the 1st year.

This is really helpful to understand as it demonstrates the great value to Coders who provide their Contributions to the Morpheus network.
But, this high reward will also generate a lot of competition among Coders. 

## Market Driven Implied Value of Code Resets Monthly
It is important to understand that the implied value is decided by the market. The amount of stETH deposited creates a certain amount of yield that in turns buys up MOR from the AMM.
This Protocol Owned Liquidity increases the scarcity of MOR and provides liquidity for Coders, Compute Providers and Community Front End developers.

## September 2nd 2023 to February 8th 2024 Implied Value of a Weight "Snapshot 1" = $0.025 USD per Weight
In theory, the initial implied value of 1 weight was $50 USD before there was a market-determined price as that is the average real cost paid to auditors & developers sponsored by Morpheus community members. However now that there is a real-world implied value of 1 weight this ought to be considered in each monthly snap shot.

## February 8th to March 8th 2024 Implied Value of a Weight Calculation "Snapshot 2" = $0.20 USD Per Weight
In theory, while the exact price of MOR will not be known until May 8th when the Uniswap pool AMM goes live, the current implied price can be estimated based on the total stETH deposited.
At 88,000 stETH annually providing 2,904 stETH in yield balanced against the 1,222,076 MOR earned by all Capital Providers the first year. 
This at least right now implies a per MOR value of 0.00237 stETH per MOR based on real world contributions. Or $6.89 USD at the current 2,900 USD to stETH price on Feb. 21st 2024.

**All told this implies a value of each weight at $400 USD for Snapshot 2 (February 8th to March 8th 2024).**
This is calculated by taking the number of MOR earned by all Coders the first year (1,222,076) and dividing by 21,000 which equals 58 MOR per weight. 
In theory this results in, $6.89 USD per MOR that equals $400 in USD terms.

## March 8th to April 8th 2024 Implied Value of a Weight Calculation "Snapshot 3" = $1.26 USD per Weight
**Note the following is all theory, presented as an example for how one could arrive at their own estimate. 
No one knows how much MOR will be worth in ETH or USD or any other currency. 1 MOR = 1 MOR**
The current implied price can be estimated based the implied value set in the secondary market for MOR tokens.
Currently secondary markets for MOR are trading at between $100 to 200 USD per MOR. By multiplying the number of MOR per day ~ 3,456 (for Coding Rewards) by 365, and then multiply that by the $100 USD price per MOR, we get the total Coder rewards for 1 year and divide by 100,000,000 we get the per weight implied theoretical price of $1.26 USD per weight.

**All told this implies a current value of each weight at $1.26 USD.**
**Note the following is all theory, presented as an example for how one could arrive at their own estimate. 
No one knows how much MOR will be worth in ETH or USD or any other currency. 1 MOR = 1 MOR**

See the Morstats.info website page where you can run these estimates dynamically. https://morstats.info/code-weights/

The proposed schedule is 1 year halving for Morpheus coding weights which fits the 16 year MOR supply curve schedule. If the implied value of weights increases by 2X each year the Code rewards will stay the same. If the implied value increases more than 2X, then Code rewards increase (as has happened so far). If the implied value of Coding weights grows less than 2X or declines then yes, there would be less Coding rewards.
